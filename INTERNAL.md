Yes. If your goal is to have a GitHub project that genuinely supports that CV bullet, then you should redesign the Docker project into a **real AWS multi-environment platform project**.

# Phase 1: Bootstrap Infrastructure (CloudFormation)

This is where CloudFormation comes in.

Terraform cannot safely create its own remote backend before using it.

So create:

```text
S3 Bucket
DynamoDB Table
```

using CloudFormation.

### backend-bootstrap.yaml

Creates:

```text
terraform-state-bucket
terraform-lock-table
```

Resources:

```yaml
Resources:

  TerraformStateBucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket

  TerraformLockTable:
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
```

Interview explanation:

> CloudFormation bootstraps Terraform backend resources because Terraform cannot reliably manage its own state backend initialization.

This is a very common enterprise pattern.

---

# Phase 2: Configure Terraform Remote State

Instead of:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "local" {}
}
```

Use:

```hcl
terraform {

  backend "s3" {

    bucket         = "terraform-state-bucket"

    key            = "dev/terraform.tfstate"

    region         = "ap-southeast-1"

    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"

    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

For prod:

```hcl
key = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
```

For stage:

```hcl
key = "stage/terraform.tfstate"
```

Now each environment has:

```text
Separate State
Shared Backend
State Locking
```

---

# Phase 3: Multi-Environment Structure

```text
environments/

├── dev
├── stage
└── prod
```

Each environment:

```hcl
module "networking" {
  source = "../../modules/networking"
}

module "compute" {
  source = "../../modules/compute"
}

module "monitoring" {
  source = "../../modules/monitoring"
}
```

Same modules.

Different variables.

---

# Phase 4: Networking Module

Create:

```text
modules/networking
```

Resources:

```text
VPC
Subnets
Internet Gateway
Route Tables
```

Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_vpc" "this"
resource "aws_subnet" "public"
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "this"
resource "aws_route_table" "this"
```

Interview point:

> Reusable VPC module consumed by all environments.

---

# Phase 5: Compute Module

Create:

```text
modules/compute
```

Resources:

```text
EC2
IAM Role
Security Group
```

Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web"
resource "aws_iam_role" "ec2_role"
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg"
```

User Data:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

yum update -y

yum install nginx -y

systemctl start nginx

systemctl enable nginx
```

EC2 automatically hosts webpage.

---

# Phase 6: Tagging Governance

Create:

```hcl
locals {

 common_tags = {
   Project     = "multi-env-platform"
   ManagedBy   = "Terraform"
   Owner       = "DevOps"
   Environment = var.environment
 }
}
```

Every resource:

```hcl
tags = local.common_tags
```

Interview answer:

> Governance enforced through centralized tagging strategy.

---

# Phase 7: CloudWatch Monitoring

Monitoring module:

```text
modules/monitoring
```

Create:

```hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm"
```

Example:

```text
CPU > 80%
```

Alarm:

```hcl
comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"

threshold = 80
```

---

# Phase 8: SNS Notifications

Create:

```hcl
resource "aws_sns_topic" "alerts"
```

Connect:

```hcl
alarm_actions = [
 aws_sns_topic.alerts.arn
]
```

Flow:

```text
EC2 High CPU
        ↓
CloudWatch Alarm
        ↓
SNS
        ↓
Email Notification
```

This directly supports:

> CloudWatch monitoring and SNS alerts.

---

# Phase 9: Lambda Automation

Create:

```text
modules/lambda
```

Python:

```python
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    print(event)

    return {
        "statusCode": 200
    }
```

Terraform:

```hcl
resource "aws_lambda_function"
```

Possible use cases:

```text
Auto-remediation
Log processing
Alarm handling
```

---

# Phase 10: GitHub Actions CI/CD

```text
.github/workflows/terraform.yml
```

Pipeline:

```text
Push
 ↓
fmt
 ↓
validate
 ↓
tfsec
 ↓
plan
 ↓
approval
 ↓
apply
```

Example:

```yaml
jobs:

  validate:

  security:

  plan:

  apply:
```

---

# Phase 11: tfsec Security Scan

Add:

```yaml
- name: tfsec
  uses: aquasecurity/tfsec-action
```

Checks:

```text
Open Security Groups
Unencrypted S3 Buckets
IAM Risks
```

Supports CV bullet:

> Integrated security scanning

---

# Phase 12: Trivy Scan

Add:

```yaml
- name: Trivy
```

Scans:

```text
Terraform Misconfigurations
Dependencies
Containers
```

Supports:

> Integrated security scanning (Trivy)

---

# Phase 13: Production Approval

GitHub Environment:

```text
dev
stage
prod
```

Configure:

```text
prod
 ↓
Required Reviewer
```

Workflow:

```yaml
environment: prod
```

Flow:

```text
Developer
    ↓
Plan
    ↓
Approval
    ↓
Apply
```

Supports:

> Controlled production deployment approvals.

---

# Phase 14: Documentation

README sections:

```text
Architecture
Terraform Modules
Backend Design
CI/CD Workflow
Security Controls
Monitoring
Deployment Process
```

Add architecture diagram:

```text

## End Result

After implementing these components, your CV statement becomes fully defensible:

✅ Terraform Modules
✅ Multi-environment (dev/stage/prod)
✅ S3 Remote State
✅ DynamoDB Locking
✅ CloudFormation Bootstrap
✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD
✅ tfsec Security Scanning
✅ Trivy Security Scanning
✅ IAM Governance
✅ CloudWatch Monitoring
✅ SNS Alerts
✅ Lambda Automation
✅ Production Approval Gates
✅ Tagging Strategy

This is the kind of project a DevOps interviewer would recognize as resembling a real enterprise Terraform platform rather than a learning/demo project.
